# Gopiandcode's IRC Client
## Built a Cheeky little IRC Client in Java

Got a little bored with the fact that recently I've been doing more reading than building systems.
Thus, to stretch my system building skills for a bit, I implemented a simple IRC client. 
There are a couple of little things that are still missing, and some bugs, but on the whole it works as I had hoped it to.

Took ages to set up the resizing and the positioning of the items of the application.

# Development Process
## Initial Diagram

The first step in constructing the system was to come up with a set of diagrams to depict how the application should look.
This also helped form the development plan for the application - by drawing out the image I could solidify the concept and
figure out the features I wanted.

Having identified the features and the data I would need in this project, I built a UML Diagram to guide the development
process. This was my first Java application, so my Swing knowledge was slightly rusty so I wasn't entirely sure of the complete
class organization, but I was able to get a rough picture down on paper.

Just for reference, once the application had been completed, I used Intellij's brilliant diagram tool to produce a complete
UML diagram to see how the system had changed in comparison to the initial digram.
