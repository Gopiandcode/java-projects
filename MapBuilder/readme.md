# Map Builder Simulation
## My first Swing Project (and also my worst)

This was a program developed out of necessity during a University assignment.
As part of the assignment, students had to code a real world robot to use it's limited sensors to navigate a maze and avoid collisions.


In order to aid with the development process, a simulator was given to the students which provided the ability to test the functionality of the robot without having to use a physical robot.


This simulator would accept map files for generating the simulation. Upon closer inspection, the files were found to be in JSON format. Having encountered parsing the JSON format in a Hackathon earlier in the year, I realized that I could develop an application to help me build my own maps.


Thus began this project. Unfortunately, at the time I had no idea as to how to properly organise a gui system, and ended up performing most of the buisiness logic in the MapBuilderGui class, leading to code spaghetti - see my [IRC Client](https://github.com/Gopiandcode/java-projects/tree/master/IRC_Client) to see how my gui development has improved.


The project was intended to give me and my (elusive) team mate (who turned up to at most 4 of the 16 session or so) the edge amongst our peers, but I ended up giving it to a team mate from another team I was in, in order to compensate him for the extra workload he was doing.
